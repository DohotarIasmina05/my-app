Librarian:

Once logged in,the librarian can add a book to the list, change the loan period of a book, or delete books that are no longer in the library.
Moreover, the librarian can access the books that were sold or borrowed that day.
The librarian can make a book available after the loan period ends by adding it to the system, or she can extend the loan period if the reader so wishes.

Reader:

The reader, after logging in, will have available a list of books that can be found in the library.
The reader can also access the books of a certain author or a certain publishing house that concerns him.
The authenticated reader will have the option to borrow or purchase that book. He can enter the number of pieces he wants and the loan period, if he wants to borrow the book.
